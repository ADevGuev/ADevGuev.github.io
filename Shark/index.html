        <h2>Here´s a couple fact about The Great White Shark</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
            1)  Great White Sharks rarely resort to combat with each other and humans. Even though shark attacks have occurred, research has shown that sharks are generally picky eaters and are not inclined to prey on humans.
            </li>
            <li>
            2)  Great White Sharks ancestry dates back more than 400 million years. Research suggests that the lifespan Great White Sharks is estimated to be at least 70 years.
            </li>
            <li>
            3)  Although these sharks are often classified as loners, there is a degree of social hierarchy that does exist among them. Female sharks often dominate males.
            </li>
            <li>
            4)  They have a tongue-like structure known as the basihyal, which is a piece of cartilage that sits on the floor of the mouth and usually does not move.
            </li>
            <li>
            5)  A Great White can devour a whole seal and won’t need to eat for another three months after that.
            </li>
            <li>
            6)  These apex predators get stressed in captivity and eventually die when they’re not in their natural environment.
            </li>
            <li>
            7)  They use their serrated teeth to shred their prey into pieces. There are approximately 300 teeth in the mouth of a Great White and they only lose 1000 over their lifespan. Each time they lose teeth a new row slides into place.
            </li>
            <li>
            8)  Sharks are hunted for their fins and teeth and are often caught in the nets of commercial and illegal fishermen. Now are an vulnerable species.
